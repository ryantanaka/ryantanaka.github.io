#### Database Systems Course Project

The assignment was to build a Java application that uses a cluster of MySQL databases to perform parallel DDL
execution, parallel SQL processing, and distributed CSV loading. This project provided insight into the CAP
theorem and shed light on how a simple distributed database system might function. Furthermore,
the project exposed me to sharding and replication.

#### Nasa Space Apps Challenge 2016 World Semi-Finalists

Game and challenge description can be found on Nasa's
 [website](https://2016.spaceappschallenge.org/challenges/mars/space-route-66/projects/koala-space-program). I programmed parts of the GUI, animations, and event handlers using C# and
MonoDevelop. Also created a weather module that simulates passing time on Mars
by programming a light source to rotate around the terrain.
Team members: Joshua Nishiguchi, Aditya Kumar, and Stephani Diep, made this project a great success. [[Video]](https://youtu.be/nqm8iJDUQQA)

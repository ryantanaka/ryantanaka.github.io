#### ATT Mobile App Hackathon 2016 2nd Place Winner

My team created a smart mailbox unit and android application that will notify a
user when mail has been inserted or removed from one's mailbox.
The hardware implementation consisted of a Raspberry Pi 2 B+, USB postage scale,
wired switches, external battery, WiFi antenna, and a custom made mailbox platform.
I was responsible for programming the login pages on the android device using Java.
My team members developed a C program that takes in data from the USB scale and pushes it to the server.
Team: Joshua Nishiguchi, Aditya Kumar, Stephani Diep, Oliver Sou, James Park, and Reed Shinsato.

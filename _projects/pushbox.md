ATT Mobile App Hackathon 2016 2nd Place Winner
My team and I created a smart mailbox unit and android application that will notify a user when mail has been inserted or removed from one's mailbox.

The hardware implementation consisted of a Raspberry Pi 2 B+, USB postage scale, wired switches, external battery, WiFi antenna, and a custom made mailbox platform.

I was responsible for programming the login pages on the android device using Java. My team members developed a C program that takes in data from the USB scale and pushes it to the server.

It was a pleasure working with Joshua Nishiguchi, Aditya Kumar, Stephani Diep, Oliver Sou, James Park, and Reed Shinsato for this project.

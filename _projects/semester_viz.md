#### Data Storage and Retrieval Course Project

At the time of this project, my school did not have a modern registration
system with a fancy user interface so I wanted to build a tool to help
students visualize their upcoming semester schedule.
When a user clicks on an offered course, it
gets added
to the user's course list and displayed on the calendar. Courses that are
already added may either be hidden from the calendar or deleted
altogether. Once the user has a desired schedule, it may be saved for
viewing at a later time. [[Video Demo]](https://youtu.be/aQtJMmEkbII)

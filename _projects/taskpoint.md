#### ATT Mobile App Hackathon 2017

Task Point is a sticky note, android application that utilizes an android
device's rear facing camera for quick qr-code scanning.
The application allows users to assign notes to each qr-code they have.
This allows for reminders to be set for very specific locations. GPS based
reminders aren't able to achieve this type of accuracy when connection is
bad.
This app was completed as a minimum viable product and submitted within 24
hours for the event. My responsibilities included building the user
interface and integrating the open source qr-code scanner.
Task Point was conceived by teammate Aditya Kumar. [[Code]](https://github.com/ryantanaka/TaskPoint)
